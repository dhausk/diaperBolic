###A React Native App for new born parents giving them the ability to keep track of their child's diaper changes. Tracking diapers is just the beginning, Diaperbolic also tracks what kind of dirty diaper was changed as well as representing all these diapers on the DiaperBolic-Curve, which is a a series of charts and graphs. Parents can add edit and delete their dirty diapers just incase they had a false alarm
